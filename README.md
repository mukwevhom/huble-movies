# Huble Movies

This project is for my Front-End Developer Assessment.

This is a movie catalog application using react. I used [TMDB Developer API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) to get movies list

With the above tools available, you are ready:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies
